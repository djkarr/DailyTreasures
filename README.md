# DailyTreasures
[Update 1/10/2022: Part of the app is no longer working (although the core functionality obviously still works) due to a third party change of the eManna website. This app is very dated now, and many things in the code are now deprecated, so I'm not going to spend the time to fix it. I am not planning on updating this app, I would do a complete rewrite if I wanted to do something. I am leaving it up here to show where I started.]

This is the first Android App I made and published.

This app showcases a lot of the Android basics such as MVC design pattern, internal file storage, SQLite database, network requests, activities, navigation, backstack, and more.
In order to create a SQLite database of all 31,102 verses I first had to use Python to parse out a 5MB text file that had some strange Windows encoding. 
Its visual design is probably the main weakness, but it's not bad for being my first app.
