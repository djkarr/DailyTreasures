# DailyTreasures
This is the first Android App I made and published.

This app showcases a lot of the Android basics such as MVC design pattern, internal file storage, SQLite database, network requests, activities, navigation, backstack, and more.
In order to create a SQLite database of all 31,102 verses I first had to use Python to parse out a 5MB text file that had strange Windows encoding. 
Its visual design is probably the main weakness, but it's not bad for being my first app.
